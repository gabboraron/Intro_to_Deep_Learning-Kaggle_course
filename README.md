# Intro to Deep Learning
Use TensorFlow and Keras to build and train neural networks for structured data.

## A Single Neuron

### What is Deep Learning?
> Some of the most impressive advances in artificial intelligence in recent years have been in the field of deep learning. Natural language translation, image recognition, and game playing are all tasks where deep learning models have neared or even exceeded human-level performance.
>
> So what is deep learning? Deep learning is an approach to machine learning characterized by deep stacks of computations. This depth of computation is what has enabled deep learning models to disentangle the kinds of complex and hierarchical patterns found in the most challenging real-world datasets.
>
> Through their power and scalability neural networks have become the defining model of deep learning. Neural networks are composed of neurons, where each neuron individually performs only a simple computation. The power of a neural network comes instead from the complexity of the connections these neurons can form.

### The Linear Unit
> So let's begin with the fundamental component of a neural network: the individual neuron. As a diagram, a neuron (or unit) with one input looks like:

The Linear Unit: $y=wx+b$ Does the formula looks familiar?  It's an equation of a line! It's the slope-intercept equation, where $w$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
